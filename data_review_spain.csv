129789,129789,Spain,"Dark in color and dense on the nose, this has aromas of pastry, blackberry, jammy plum and even an exotic note. It feels chewy and solid, with a full-bodied texture and deep flavors of black cherry and prune. It comes up a bit short and clipped on the finish.",Clisos Reserva,89,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,federico paternina 2006 clisos reserva rioja,Tempranillo,Federico Paternina
129794,129794,Spain,"Attractive and fruity on the front end, this has pure berry aromas but not a lot of nuance or complexity. It narrows a bit on the palate, with tight tannins that support the black fruit and coffee flavors. Juicy, bright and solid on the finish.",Secreto Reserva,89,,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,viña mayor 2006 secreto reserva ribera del duero,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
129799,129799,Spain,"Black in color and dense on the nose, this has well-oaked aromas of black fruit, lemon peel and cedar. It feels full and fresh, with good acidity and prickly tannins. It tastes juicy and clean, with berry, black plum, vanilla, tobacco and spice flavors that carry through onto the finish.",Divus,88,19.0,Levante,Jumilla,bodegas bleda 2009 divus monastrell jumilla,Monastrell,Bodegas Bleda
129856,129856,Spain,"Lime and grapefruit aromas are a touch pithy and feline but don't go overboard. Citrusy and minerally on the palate, this tastes of lime, green melon and green banana. A pure, tangy finish holds firm.",Ethereo,90,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,bodegas eidosela 2015 ethereo albariño rías baixas,Albariño,Bodegas Eidosela
129870,129870,Spain,"Cool, minty aromas of blueberry and blackberry set up a full, tannic palate, which is what you'd expect from a young Ribera del Duero. Grabby, tannic fullness offers flavors of meaty black fruits, herbs and tobacco. A savory finish runs long on a frame of blocky tannins.",,90,45.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,bodegas y viñedos tábula 2014 ribera del duero,Tempranillo,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula
129881,129881,Spain,"This Verdejo smells like citrus fruits and wild field grass, with a hint of feline aroma. Crisp and fresh, it offers flavors of melon, nectarine and nettle. A long, slightly salty finish is braced by bright acidity. Drink right away, if possible.",,90,19.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,martinsancho 2015 verdejo rueda,Verdejo,Martinsancho
129884,129884,Spain,"After 23 months in barrel, this Viura-Malvasia blend shows a yellow color and dry resiny oak-based aromas along with apple in the backdrop. Round and slightly oily in texture, this tastes of salted nuts and baked apple on a woody base. Oaky salty flavors persist on the finish.",Gran Reserva,91,43.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,valserrano 2009 gran reserva white rioja,White Blend,Valserrano
129902,129902,Spain,"Dry apple and lemon aromas are clean and one step above neutral. In the mouth, this barrel-fermented Verdejo feels full and flush, with citrusy acidity.

129928,129928,Spain,"This represents Torres' highest effort in Priorat, and it's a success. Perpetual deals freshly laid asphalt, cola and grilled char on the nose and then follows that up with black cherry, cassis and tobacco flavors. It's pure and ripe more than intellectual. Best 2009–2013; 60 cases produced.",Salmos Perpetual,91,52.0,Catalonia,Priorat,torres 2005 salmos perpetual red priorat,Red Blend,Torres
129930,129930,Spain,"Arguably on the heavy and rich side, but if you like chocolate, spice and pretty good pop across the palate, this is recommended. Rugged but not out of whack, with meaty dark-fruit flavors and bitter espresso/pepper on the finish. Should come together nicely over the next two years.",Crianza,91,26.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,costaval 2005 crianza ribera del duero,Tempranillo Blend,Costaval
129957,129957,Spain,"Lightly baked berry aromas vie for attention with leather, spice and mild earth notes, and the result is disjointed. On the palate, this is tight as a drum initially, but more expansive as it unfolds. Cherry, plum, raspberry, vanilla and woodspice flavors finish pure, clean and easy. This is a fine yet manageable Rioja that's not trying too hard. Drink through 2016.",Crianza,90,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,viñedos real rubio 2010 crianza rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Viñedos Real Rubio
